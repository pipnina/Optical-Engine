VERSION: TBD

    MenuBar:
        MenuBar now has a link to the ComponentFactory
        MenuBAr now actually triggers creation of components under "New" tab.
        
    ComponentFactory:
        ComponentFactory now has a link to the ComponentManager
        
    ComponentManager:
        addLens() and addMirror() have been replaced with addComponent(Component*), no longer creates components itself.
        
        ComponentManager is now blind to subtypes of Component, it is left to classes accessing the components to deal with subtype details.
        
        ComponentPointer no longer exists as a struct, all Components are stored in a single std::vector<Component> inside ComponentManager
        
    ComponentUI:
        updateList() now assumes that the std::vector holding components in ComponentManager also controls the component's position in the optical system.
        
    Lens:
        Now sets its name to "Lens" in class constructor
        
    Mirror:
        Now sets its name to "Mirror" in class constructor
